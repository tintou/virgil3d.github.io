The plan is to have a guest GPU that is fully independent of the host GPU.\r\n\r\n## What exactly does it entail?\r\nThe project entails creating a virtual 3D capable graphics card for virtual machines running inside qemu. The design of this card is based around the concepts of Gallium3D to make writing Mesa and (eventually) Direct3D drivers for it easy. The card natively uses the Gallium TGSI intermediate representation for its shaders. The implementation of rendering for the card is done in the host\r\nsystem as part of qemu and is implemented purely on OpenGL so you can accelerated rendering on any sufficiently capable card/driver combination.\r\n\r\nThe project also consists of a complete Linux guest stack, composed of a Linux kernel KMS driver, X.org 2D DDX driver and Mesa 3D driver.\r\n\r\n## Current status\r\n- Many pieces are now upstreamed in various projects.\r\n\r\n- Kernel\r\n  Linux 4.2 contains the modesetting only drivers.\r\n  Linux 4.4 contains the 3D supported pieces.\r\n\r\n- Mesa\r\n  Mesa master contains the virgl 3D driver.\r\n\r\n- QEMU\r\n  QEMU 2.4 contained the initial virtio-gpu with no acceleration support.\r\n  QEMU 2.5 contains 3D support only with the GTK3 frontend with GL enabled.\r\n\r\n- virglrenderer\r\n  The virglrenderer library seems mostly API stable.\r\n\r\n### So what can it do now?\r\nRun a desktop and most 3D games I've thrown at it.\r\n\r\n## Scope\r\nThe project is currently investigating the desktop virtualisation use case only. This use case is where the viewer, host and guest are all running on the same machine (i.e. workstation or laptop). Some areas are in scope for future investigation but not being looked at, at this time.\r\n\r\n### Future scope\r\n* Remoting rendering using a codec solution.\r\n* Windows guest, Direct3D drivers.\r\n* Other architectures\r\n* Limited environment renderer (GLES2)\r\n\r\n### Out of scope\r\n* Passing through GPUs or subsets of GPU capabilities.\r\n\r\n# Repos\r\nAll upstream parts are being developed upstream.\r\n\r\nvirglrenderer: the GL renderer\r\nhttps://gitlab.freedesktop.org/virgl/virglrenderer\r\n\r\n# Authors and Contributors\r\nVirgil is a research project undertaken by Dave Airlie at Red Hat. It builds on lots of open source work in a number of projects, primarily the Gallium 3D code from the Mesa project. \r\n\r\n# Support or Contact\r\nmailing list:\r\nvirglrenderer-devel@lists.freedesktop.org\r\n\r\nhttps://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/virglrenderer-devel\r\n\r\nirc:\r\n`#virgil3d` on freenode\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
